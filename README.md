# Deque_Implementation

## My Deque Implementation using circular array and doubly-linked list. 

### Deque supports the following operations:
    
    addFirst;
    addLast;
    isEmpty;
    size;
    printDeque;
    removeFirst;
    removeLast;
    get;
    
### the circular array implementation also has dynamic resizing implemented as an optimization
